          <h3>Project 1</h3>
          <p>
            This was a website I developed for a local business. I was
            responsible for designing and developing the website from scratch.
            The website was a great success and helped the business increase its
            online presence.

          <h3>project 2</h3>
          <p>
            This was a website I developed for a non-profit organization. I was
            responsible for designing and developing the website while also
            considering the organization's accessibility needs. The website was
            a success and helped the organization reach a wider audience.
