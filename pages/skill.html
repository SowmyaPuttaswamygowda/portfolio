        <h3>Project 1</h3>
        <p>
          This was a website I developed for a local business. I was
          responsible for designing and developing the website from scratch.
          The website was a great success and helped the business increase its
          online presence.

        <h3>project 2</h3>
        <p>
          This was a website I developed for a non-profit organization. I was
          responsible for designing and developing the website while also
          considering the organization's accessibility needs. The website was
          a success and helped the organization reach a wider audience.
